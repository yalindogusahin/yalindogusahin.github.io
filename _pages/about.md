Hello! 👋

I would like to thank [Emre Güçlü](https://www.emreguclu.io/) for enlightening me about Jekyll. Thanks to him, I have created this website where I maintain my own blogs that no one pays attention to. (I also stole the copy code part from him 😁 )

This is my post about my experiences working as a Platform Engineer at Trendyol. Trendyol is one of the leading ecommerce brands in Turkey, and working in their technology department has been an exciting journey for me.

**Work Environment and Technologies:**
As a Platform Engineer at Trendyol, I focus on technologies like Kafka, Nginx CDN, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, and Python. These technologies are used to manage the company's infrastructure in a robust and scalable manner. The culture and diverse projects within the organization provide continuous learning and growth opportunities.

**Terraform and Infrastructure Management:**
We use Terraform for infrastructure management, enabling us to code-manage resources on cloud providers, making it easier to build repeatable and reliable infrastructure.

**Ansible and Automation:**
Ansible is used for configuring and managing both infrastructure and applications. Automation empowers our teams to be more efficient and effective.

**Python and Tool Development:**
Python is the primary language we use for developing tools and services within the platform team. Our tools automate processes and improve the team's workflow.

Working at Trendyol has been a fulfilling experience that satisfies my passion for technology. Leveraging evolving technologies, I take pride in contributing to the success of the company.

See you around! 👋👋
