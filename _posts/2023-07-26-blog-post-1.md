## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have WSL 2 installed on your Windows machine. If you haven't installed WSL 2 yet, follow the official Microsoft documentation for [installing WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

## Chained Prompting

We will use chained prompting to guide you through the installation process. Please follow the instructions and provide the necessary input when prompted.

**1. Installing Homebrew (brew)**

Homebrew is a package manager for Linux that makes it easy to install various software packages.

To install Homebrew, open your WSL 2 terminal and run the following command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once installed, add the Homebrew path to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file:
```bash
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

**2. Installing Git**

Git is essential for version control. To install Git via Homebrew, run:
```bash
brew install git
```

**3. Installing kubectl**

kubectl is the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. To install kubectl, run:
```bash
brew install kubectl
```

**4. Installing krew**

krew is a plugin manager for kubectl, which allows you to extend kubectl's functionality with additional plugins. To install krew, run:
```bash
brew install krew
```

Once installed, add the following line to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file:
```
export PATH="${KREW_ROOT:-$HOME/.krew}/bin:$PATH"
```

**5. Installing fzf**

fzf is a powerful command-line fuzzy finder. To install fzf, run:
```bash
brew install fzf
```

After installing fzf, add the following line to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file:
```bash
source /usr/share/doc/fzf/examples/key-bindings.bash
```

**6. Installing kubectx and kubens**

kubectx and kubens allow you to switch between Kubernetes contexts and namespaces effortlessly. To install kubectx and kubens, run:
```bash
brew install kubectx kubens
```

**7. Installing kube-ps1**

kube-ps1 is a script that displays the current Kubernetes context and namespace in your shell prompt. To install kube-ps1, run:
```bash
brew install kube-ps1
```

Once installed, add the following line to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file:
```bash
source "/usr/local/opt/kube-ps1/share/kube-ps1.sh"
```

**8. Installing Minikube**

Minikube is a tool for running Kubernetes clusters locally. To install Minikube, run:
```bash
brew install minikube
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have now set up essential tools for Platform Engineers in WSL 2. These tools will help you manage Kubernetes clusters, version control with Git, and improve your overall productivity in your development and operations tasks.

Remember to check the official documentation of each tool for further usage and advanced configurations.

If you encounter any issues during the installation process, refer to the respective tool's official websites for troubleshooting and support.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
