Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This is my post about my experiences working as a Platform Engineer at LC Waikiki. LC Waikiki is one of the leading retail brands in Turkey, and working in their technology department has been an exciting journey for me.

**Work Environment and Technologies:**
As a Platform Engineer at LC Waikiki, I focus on technologies like Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, and Python. These technologies are used to manage the company's infrastructure in a robust and scalable manner. The culture and diverse projects within the organization provide continuous learning and growth opportunities.

**Kubernetes and Microservices:**
LC Waikiki's infrastructure is built on a microservices architecture. We use Kubernetes to deploy, monitor, and scale these microservices, ensuring high availability and performance of our applications.

**Terraform and Infrastructure Management:**
We use Terraform for infrastructure management, enabling us to code-manage resources on cloud providers, making it easier to build repeatable and reliable infrastructure.

**Ansible and Automation:**
Ansible is used for configuring and managing both infrastructure and applications. Automation empowers our teams to be more efficient and effective.

**Python and Tool Development:**
Python is the primary language we use for developing tools and services within the platform team. Our tools automate processes and improve the team's workflow.

Working at LC Waikiki has been a fulfilling experience that satisfies my passion for technology. Leveraging evolving technologies, I take pride in contributing to the success of the company.
